# Exercises

These are a series of small programming exercises and projects I've have done. I have decided to document them as part of a ongoing journalization of my progress as a developer. These are not all correct. These do not strive for best practices. These are not professional. These are just me screwing around with code, learning, and having fun.

Each exercise will have an accompanying README which I have been posting to my personal blog. These are not guides or tutorials necessarily, but if others find them useful - that's great!

Thanks,
